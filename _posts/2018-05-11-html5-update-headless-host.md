The html5 version of haxball does a lot of things that are unnecesary when trying to host on a VPS (rendering, audio, GUI / menus).

To improve this situation I’ve implemented a “headless” version which does no rendering audio or GUI and is controllable through a javascript API.

Read the documentation [here.](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host)

Also, starting today creating a room will require passing a recaptcha test.

Enjoy!
