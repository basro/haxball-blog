As mentioned in the last update, netcode bugs have now been fixed and the game will now be more robust in the face of packet loss.

You might also notice red bars appearing in the ping graph, these red bars signify a ping packet being lost. Packet loss is bad mkay, but not so bad now thanks to the netcode improvements.
