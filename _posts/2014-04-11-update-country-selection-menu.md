HaxBall now lets you change your country and location, to do so go to the options menu and click the “Change Country” button.

The way in which HaxBall detects your location is not infallible and often results in a wrong country. This change will let players correct it when it’s wrong (Or whenever they feel like it).

Enjoy!

Edit: Changing countries from inside a room is now disabled, to access the menu you can open the options menu from the rooms list.
