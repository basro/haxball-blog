 **Changes:**

- The chat log will no longer reset it’s position to the bottom when a new message arrives while you were scrolling through it.
- Lot’s of tiny bug fixes inside the chat log which no one will notice anyway.

The chat log used to be very annoying to scroll through, almost impossible to read what was said in the log when people are still sending messages. This update hopefully addresses that problem and makes the chat log actually useful for a change.

Enjoy!
