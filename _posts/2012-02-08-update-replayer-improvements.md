 **Changes:**

- Added a progress bar to the replayer control panel. Clicking on it will make HaxBall fast forward until it reaches that position, this emulates some form of video seeking.

Yes, just one change! Since this change doesnâ€™t break backwards compatibility I decided to release asap.

This feature is only available for replays recorded after the previous update.

Enjoy!
