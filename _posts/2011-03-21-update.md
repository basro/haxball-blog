Changes:

- Increased the display frame rate of the game to 60 FPS (was 30 before).
- Made the game logic speed independent of frame rate (slow computers unable to run at 60 FPS will be able to play just fine). This also fixes the lag caused by the host changing tabs in his browser (although the ping will go up a bit the game should remain playable).
- Changed a Flash setting (_wmode=direct_) which drastically improves the rendering performance (needed for smooth 60 FPS). Unfortunately on Windows this setting also reduces the quality of the text rendering, but the performance increase makes it worth it.
- Fine tuned the network code a bit, the game now uses less bandwidth and the latency should be slightly improved.
- Players with admin rights are now marked by a yellow nickname in the player list.

Note that the physics are completely unchanged (previous versions of haxball were running two steps of simulation per displayed frame).

Enjoy!

Edit: It seems this update is causing problems for a few players, I tested it in many different systems before releasing it, but it seems it was not enough. I am now working on an update that will make this last changes optional. So to all of you having problems: remain calm, help is on the way!
