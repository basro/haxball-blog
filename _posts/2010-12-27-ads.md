As of now HaxBall has ads. I know nobody likes them, me included, but as the popularity of the game grows so do the hosting costs, and sadly donations aren’t enough (though many great thanks to everyone who donated&nbsp;♥).

We tried to use ads that keep nagging to a minimum and don’t affect the fun of the game. Hopefully nobody will be mortally offended.

Love,

Basro
