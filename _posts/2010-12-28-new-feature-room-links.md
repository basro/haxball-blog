With the huge amounts of players came huge amounts of rooms, which made finding a specific room quite an annoying task. Room links are here to solve that :)

To use a room link just press the menu button in a game, copy the room URL and give it to a friend.

Another small new feature is the option to not display the room in the room list. This, in combination with room links, can be an nice alternative to password-protected rooms.

Enjoy :)
