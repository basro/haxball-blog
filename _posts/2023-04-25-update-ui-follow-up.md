This update adds an option to make the chat background have a very similar look to how it was before while retaining the new features like being resizeable and having configurable opacity.

**Changes:**
 * Added Chat background width option to settings -> video. Selecting 'Full' will make the chat look a lot like it did before.
 * Fixed a problem where defocusing the chat with tab would cause the menu button to silently be focused. Players using the spacebar to kick would open the menu without intending to.

I've heard a lot of feedback and I'll be addressing more points soon.
