I’ve just found out about it and I’m working to fix it.

**Update:**

As far as I’ve seen the problem seems to fix itself if you close and open the browser again. It’s probably something going wrong on the servers of the geolocation service I’m using. So if you are having trouble try closing and opening the browser again.
