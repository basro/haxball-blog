Small update that gives room hosts the ability to require joining players to complete a recaptcha challenge.

**Changes:**
 * Added [/recaptcha](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Chat-Commands#recaptcha-onoff) chat command.
 * Added [setRecaptchaRequired](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host#setrequirerecaptcha) to headless host room object.
 * Improved message shown when failing to connect to a room. Instead of just saying "Failed" it now links to the connection issues wiki page.
 * Improved message shown when trying to join a room that has already been closed.
