### Changes:

- Replay recording and playing.
- Some bugfixes.

Because these new replay files are incompatible with the ones created with the flash version the extension has changed to “.hbr2”.

There’s currently no way to link directly to a replay file, I’ll implement that feature soon. For now the only way to load a replay is from the room list “Replays” button.

I wish you all a happy new year!
