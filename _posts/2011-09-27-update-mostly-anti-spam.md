 **Changes:**

- Implemented chat throttling. When a user spams too much his messages will queue up and be sent only once every two seconds.
- Reduced the max length of a single chat message to 125 characters (from 250 which was way longer than needed)
- Improved Ban. It’s no secret that the previous ban implementation was as simple to avoid as clearing flash cache. Not anymore.
- Fixed a bug which made the “X team is victorious” message not appear when the game ends on time limit.

Enjoy less spammable games! ;)
