Changes:

- Replaced the ESC menu with the lobby, which is now reachable even during a match in progress. Leaving the room, obtaining the room link and stopping an ongoing match can now be done from the lobby.
- Removed the players list, its functionality is now available in the lobby as well.
- Admins can now move players into a team during a match without the need to restart the game.
- When a player leaves a game his body is removed from the field. I bet someone will miss the corpses, but it didnâ€™t really make a lot of sense :P
- The room name is now visible in the header of the lobby screen.

Enjoy!
