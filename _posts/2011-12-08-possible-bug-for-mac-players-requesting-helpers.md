Apparently some Mac users are getting desynchronized since the latest updates. I have an idea of why this is happening but I don’t own a Mac so I can’t make any tests.

If you own a Mac and you are getting desynchronized I’d appreciate if you could spend a few minutes helping me test some things. Send me an email to haxball@gmail.com

Thanks!

**Update:** I got to make the tests I needed. The bug is found and fixed. I’ll be releasing an update at midnight which fixes this bug.

**Update:** Released! mac users should not desynchronize anymore.
