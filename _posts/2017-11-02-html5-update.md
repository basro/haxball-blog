### Changes:

- Implemented /avatar and /clear\_avatar commands
- Implemented restricted view size mode (selected with Number 4 for now)
- The game will now remember your prefered viewmode/zoom level.
- The game will now automatically try reverse connection if forward connection fails, this should fix improve the connection success chance for a number of people. (This is related to the reverse\_setting that was available already, it will try using that setting automatically now)
- Implemented a shorter timeout for players that have disconnected but didn’t properly leave the room. It’s 30 seconds now.
- Fixed bug where players would become invisble and unable to move when starting a game.
- A bunch of other smaller bug fixes.
