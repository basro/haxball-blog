 **Changes:**

- Added a pause button that admins can use. It should be useful for when a player leaves, you can pause the game while you fix the teams. I understand very well that crappy room admins will be even more annoying with this feature in their power, but bad admins can be pretty annoying without it &nbsp;anyway. If someone abuses it just find another room ;)
- Added a tooltip to the replay progress bar which tells you the game time at that point. (Only works on replays made with this and future versions)

Enjoy!
