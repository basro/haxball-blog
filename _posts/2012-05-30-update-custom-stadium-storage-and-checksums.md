This update is meant to help leagues and other organizations that want to play custom stadiums in a competitive environment. It also makes hosting and sharing custom stadiums way less of a hassle.

**Changes:**

- Added a **/store&nbsp;** chat command which stores the currently loaded stadium. Stored stadiums will appear in the stadium picker list marked yellow.
- Added a delete button to the stadium picker list, it lets you remove previously stored custom stadiums.
- When a custom stadium is loaded the game will now display it’s checksum in the chat. The checksum can be used to identify a custom stadium and prevent fakes.
- Added a **/checksum** chat command, using it will display the checksum of the currently loaded stadium. (Useful in case you joined after the stadium was loaded)

Stored stadiums can easily be lost so don’t depend on them to be there forever, keep the .hbs files on your hard drive.

Enjoy!
