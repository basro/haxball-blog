Changes:

- Brand new options menu which is accessible from the room list and during the game.
- Moved the mute sound button into the options menu.
- Made a frames per seconds limit option which it lets you choose between 30 and 60 FPS. Useful for those with slow computers which canâ€™t run the game smoothly at 60 FPS.
- Made Flash hardware acceleration optional. This caused blank screens for a few people. A warning will appear during the login screen which will let people with blank screens disable it.

My apologies to those of you who were negatively affected by the previous update, this update should fix your problems :)

Enjoy!
