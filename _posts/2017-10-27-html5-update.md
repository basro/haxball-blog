### Changes:

- Implemented arrows pointing to players outside of the view.
- Probably fixed the bug that causes the host to randomly kick players with “bad actor” as reason. (It is hard to reproduce so I’m not 100% certain, I’ll be keeping an eye out for it to see that it is truly fixed.)
- Disabled gamepad input support for now. It was causing problems to players that had been playing with gamepad using key mapping software.
- Default player name is now empty, forcing players to actually pick a nick.
- Default value for max players changed to 12.

More updates to come soon.
