By popular demand the restricted view mode is back, however it is now bound to number 0 instead of number 4.

**Changes:**
 * Brings back restricted view mode.
 * Adds hardcoded key binding of number 0 to set the restricted view mode.
 * Extrapolation limits have been increased to 1000.
 * Fixed bug where overtime text was visible when the game lobby menu is visible.
