 **Changes:**

- &nbsp;Implemented player banning as a toggle in the kick menu. The ban lasts for as long as the room is up.
- The avatar is now remembered, set it once and it will be the same the next time you play.
- Fixed a bug in which holding down Enter when inputing the room password would make you join the room multiple times.

I would also like to call your attention to these very useful community sites:

- [HaxBall.gr](http://www.haxball.gr) — League & Cup generator for Haxball. Keep track of your Tournaments!
- [HaxBallTube](http://www.haxballtube.com)&nbsp;— Mimics YouTube’s interface but for HaxBall replay files.
- [HaxBall DB](http://www.haxballdb.com)&nbsp;— Lets you upload, link to and comment on HaxBall replays.

Enjoy!
