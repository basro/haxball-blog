Just released a small change on the HaxBall client

Changes:

- Added a team reset button which lets the room admin quickly turn everyone into spectators.
- Modified “Auto” button, instead of filling the teams to max capacity it will pick a random pair of players per click.
- Fixed a bug which caused players to become stuck in the middle of the field after a goal was scored.

I’m working on implementing more admin tools (player kicking, promoting to admin, etc) but since it will take a while I decided to release these smaller changes now.

Have fun :)
