 **Changes:**

- Removed the “Country” column in the room list, instead the flags are now shown in the “~Distance” column. As a side effect the room names now have more space.
- Made the chat reject newline characters, some players were exploiting this to send chat messages as someone else in the room.
- Made players move to the bottom of the list when they change teams. In the past the players would always be sorted in the order they joined the room. This change should make it easier for admins to remember who is next in line.
- Added team reset buttons for admins, they move all the players on a specific team to spectators.
- Added a bunch of features to the .hbs format: The possibility to set the initial speed of discs and edit the physical properties of the ball and the players. This .hbs file shows how to use the new features: [newfeatures\_tutorial.hbs](http://haxball.com/static/stadiums/newfeatures_tutorial.hbs). No real documentation page yet though, sorry ;o

Enjoy!
