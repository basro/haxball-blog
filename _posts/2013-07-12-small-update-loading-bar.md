Changes:

- A loading bar is now displayed while HaxBall is loading.
- Fixed the hud messages (ie “Red Team Scores”) so that they don’t remain visible when a game admin stops and starts a new match.
- Added “¿¡+\*@#$%¬^” to the list of characters players can use in their avatars.
- Some internal cleaning of the source.

That’s it, enjoy!
