 **Changes:**

- Resuming a paused game now has a 2 seconds delay during which a progress bar is displayed.
- Fixed a bug in which typing the letter p in the kick reason would pause the game.
- Slightly lowered the replayer time tooltip position so that it doesnâ€™t get cropped out if the window is too small.
- Made some internal changes to the server to make the geolocation more robust.

Enjoy!
