Changes:

- Fixed a bug which caused the overtime message to be shown when there’s no time limit, I knew I had forgotten something :P
- Did some tweaks to the hockey stadium, it felt a bit cramped to me so I made it a tad bigger by reducing the play area margin. I also made the net impassable by players (in 4v4 a team could clog the goal but this map is meant for 3v3 or less).
- By popular demand I hackily added a sound mute button. I don’t like the placement or looks of this button so it will probably be moved somewhere else later on, but it’s better than not having one at all :)

Enjoy!
