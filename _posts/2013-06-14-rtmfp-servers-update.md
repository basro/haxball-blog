I changed where the RTMFP server is hosted (which should solve the problem for now).

This required an update to the flash game client. If you are still having problems be sure to **refresh the site** and **clear you browser cache**.

Unfortunately this time the game won’t be able to tell it’s users that they are running on an old version, so please help spread the word that a refresh is required.
