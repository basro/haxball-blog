Hereâ€™s the change list:

- Limited the length of nicknames to 25 characterss (People were using this to bring down rooms).
- Implemented a room number of players limit, this is configurable in the room creation menu.
- Guest is not the default nickname anymore, players now need to fill the nick with something in order to play.
- Text input boxes now have hints when empty. :)

In other news, it has been a week since HaxBall was released and the number of visits has already surpassed 100k :D
