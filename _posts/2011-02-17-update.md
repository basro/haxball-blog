Changes:

- Changed how the overtime message is shown, instead of covering the playfield it now appears next to the timer. Also, now the timer will continue even after overtime is reached.
- Added a new stadium: Hockey! This was initially intended to be ice hockey themed but I did not manage to make the color scheme work well (ice needing to be white-ish brought contrast issues) so instead I went for some sort of street hockey theme :P
- Fixed a bug which made pressing cancel before the game connects to the RTMFP server not work. Also failing to connect to the RTMFP server is now handled (before it would just get stuck in that screen).
- Some other smaller bugfixes.

Enjoy!
