Changes:

- Implemented a player list which you can inspect even during a match in progress.
- Player kicking! Use it responsibly ;)
- Admins can now give/take admin powers to other players.
- Team selection menu is now prettier and easier to use.

To use the kicking or admin give/take features open the player list and click on the button that appears next to the players name.

Enjoy!
