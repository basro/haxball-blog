There seems to be a new bug in town which is causing the connection process to hang in the “Waiting for game state” stage. I have not made any changes to the game recently so I’m quite baffled about why it might have started happening.

In any case, I’m just posting to say that I’m aware of the problem and working to fix it. So don’t panic, HaxBall will return to being fully operational soon.

**Update:**

The bug is a tricky one, I don’t know exactly why happens and I was not able to find a good way to reproduce it reliably.

I just released an update which may fix the bug. I’m not 100% certain that it is fixed but I was unable to reproduce the bug with this new version, fingers crossed.
