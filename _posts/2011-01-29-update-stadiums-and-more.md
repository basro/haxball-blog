 **Changes:**

- Stadiums! Room admins can select from 5 differently shaped stadiums to play on!
- Own player highlight! Your own nick is no longer displayed under your player, instead now thereâ€™s a highlighting ring around the disc you control.
- Camera improvements! One of the stadiums is bigger than the game viewport, to make it playable I improved the follow behavior of the camera and implemented arrows that point to unseen game objects.
- Some bugfixes ;)

Enjoy!
