Typing ‘@’ in the chat will now open a list of all players. You can then select a player with the arrow keys and press TAB to autocomplete. Continuing to type will also filter the list, making it easier to quickly find the player you are looking for.

If someone mentions your nick using this system you will get a highlighted text and a different chat sound (Which can be disabled in the settings). This feature will probably be useful when trying to call the attention of players that are perhaps distracted browsing a on a different tab.

Also, pressing # will do a similar thing but the TAB key will autocomplete using the player’s id number. This should be helpful for referring players when issuing commands to headless room scripts since the id will be unambiguous and easy to parse by the headless room’s script.
