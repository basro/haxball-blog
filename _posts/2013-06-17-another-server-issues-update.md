Apparently, after the rtmfp server change, a few players are having issues connecting to hosts they were previously able to. This is why I will be changing back to the previous server again soon (probably 24 hours after this update is released).

This update adds some internal functionality that is necessary for a smooth switching of servers in the future.

Thatâ€™s it, sorry for the inconvenience. ;)
