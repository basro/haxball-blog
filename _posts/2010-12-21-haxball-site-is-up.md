My good friend Jonathan Sully kindly donated his time to make this site for HaxBall. Another donation is the lovely logo that can be seen in the about page, made by my other good friend Qualo.  
  
In other news there has been a few changes to the HaxBall flash client, the most important of them is that now only the room host can use the admin controls of the game. (Unless the “Everyone is admin” option is set). Another small change is that now you can see other people’s country flag in the game lobby.
